# eth_python_tracker
Welcome! This is a Python-based Dash app meant to track Whale activity in buy / sell walls on GDAX. It is set to update every 10 seconds but this can be changed easily in the code if you want to make the refreshes faster / slower. 

Anyone interested with Python installed on their computer can download this and run it locally, just check to be sure you have the few required modules installed.

A screenshot of what it should look like when running is included. Buys / sells are color-coded, and the size of each observation is deteremined by the square root of the volume of that particular order. 

This is my first Python / Dash app, and I hope it is of use to many of you! I may publish it online in the future, but presently it is computationally easiest to run your own local version. ETH donations appreciated: '0x966796A6334EA1302d9Edb03072dB55241145401'
