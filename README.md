# eth_python_tracker
Python-based Dash app meant to track Whale activity in buy / sell walls on GDAX.

This is my first Python / Dash app. ETH donations appreciated: '0x966796A6334EA1302d9Edb03072dB55241145401'

Presently, there are 2 issues for which I am seeking solutions (and would appreciate advice):

1 - automating the data pull so that it doens't require manual refresh.

2 - hosting this publicly so that the wonderful ETH community can use it! (I don't have experience publishing Dash apps, so any advice would be great.)
